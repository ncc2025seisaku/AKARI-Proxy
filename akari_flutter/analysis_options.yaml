# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

# Exclude generated/third-party code and temporary files from analysis
analyzer:
  exclude:
    - rust_builder/**
    - "**/frb_generated.*.dart"
    - "*.dart"  # Root level dart files (test scripts)
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    - "**/*.freezed.dart"
  errors:
    # Treat deprecated_member_use_from_same_package as info, not warning
    deprecated_member_use_from_same_package: info

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    avoid_print: false  # Allow print statements for debugging/logging
